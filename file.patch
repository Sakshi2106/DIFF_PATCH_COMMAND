*** 1,12 ****
 The Nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth;
! The named is the mother of all things.
! therefore let there always be non-being,
    so we may see their subtlety,
 And let there always be being,
   so we may see their outcome.
 The two are the same,
 But after they are produced,
   they have different names.
- They both may be called deep and profound.
- Deeper and more profound,
- The door of all subtleties!
